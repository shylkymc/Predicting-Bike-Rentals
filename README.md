# Predicting-Bike-Rentals
<br>
In this project, I used data set which is collected at the Universiy of Porto. This data set has information about bike rental from bike sharing locations in Washington D.C. 
I made explatory analysis and categorized hour information. After exploratory analysis, I tried different machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of rentals. 
I calculated the MSE(mean squared error) to test my models success.

First, I set linear regression model and the MSE value is, 16687, really high with this model. Second, I used decision tree models. With decision tree models, the MSE, 2618, value dropped to good levels.
In my last step, I used random forest regression model and I got the best MSE value. For this project, the best MSE value is 1854.4.
